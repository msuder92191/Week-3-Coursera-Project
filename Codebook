# Code Book
This code book is for summary purposes of the resulting data fields in 'tidy.txt' format

## Data Set Background
Experiments were performed on an age demograpic rangning from 19-48 years old,
where each participant (n=30) were measured on his or her performance on six activites (see Activites Performed by subjects below)
while wearing a smartphone on their waistt.


## ID of data set
subject - Test subjects
activity - What activity was performed by the test subject in reltaion to a measured action
